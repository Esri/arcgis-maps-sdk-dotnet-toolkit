# ArcGIS Runtime SDK for .NET - Toolkit

The ArcGIS Runtime SDK for .NET Toolkit contains controls and utilities you can use with [ArcGIS Runtime SDK for .NET](http://links.esri.com/dotnetsdk).

You can use the Toolkit in your projects by:
1. Building the source code available in this repo (see instructions below)
2. Installing the latest stable release or pre-release from NuGet
    - Stable: [![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/Esri.ArcGISRuntime.Toolkit.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Esri.ArcGISRuntime.Toolkit)
    - Pre-release: [![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/vpre/Esri.ArcGISRuntime.Toolkit.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Esri.ArcGISRuntime.Toolkit/absolutelatest)   

Two concurrent and supported versions of ArcGIS Runtime SDK are available: 100.x and 10.2.x

- [100.x (current version)](https://developers.arcgis.com/net/latest/)
- [10.2.x (previous version)](https://developers.arcgis.com/net/10-2/)

**The Toolkit for v100.x is currently in Beta: [Get the latest!](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Esri.ArcGISRuntime.Toolkit/absolutelatest)**

## Features

- Compass: Shows a compass direction when the map is rotated. Auto-hides when the map points north up.
- FeatureDataField: Displays and optionally allows editing of a single field attribute of a feature.
- Legend: Displays a legend for a single layer in your map (and optionally for its sub layers).
- MeasureToolbar: Allows measurement of distances and areas on the map view.
- ScaleLine: Displays current scale reference.
- SignInForm: Displays a UI dialog to enter or select credentials to use when accessing secure ArcGIS resources.
- ChallengeHandler: Displays SignInForm when accessing secure ArcGIS resources, as well as helper classes for storing credentials in Windows' credentials cache. 
- SymbolDisplay: Renders a symbol in a control.
- TableOfContents: Creates a tree-view of the entire map document. Optionally displays legend information for the layers.

## Instructions for Building

1. Confirm that your system meets the requirements for compiling the Toolkit:
    - Visual Studio 2017 Update 3 (or later) with the following workloads:
        - `Universal Windows Platform development` (UWP)
        - `.NET desktop development` (WPF)
        - `Mobile development with .NET` (Xamarin.Android, Xamarin.iOS, and Xamarin.Forms)
        - '.NET Core 2.0 SDK'
2. Confirm your system meets the requirements for developing with ArcGIS Runtime SDK for .NET:
   - [WPF](http://developers.arcgis.com/net/desktop/guide/system-requirements.htm)
   - [UWP](https://developers.arcgis.com/net/latest/uwp/guide/system-requirements.htm)
   - [Xamarin.Android](https://developers.arcgis.com/net/latest/android/guide/system-requirements.htm)
   - [Xamarin.iOS](https://developers.arcgis.com/net/latest/ios/guide/system-requirements.htm)
   - [Xamarin.Forms (Android, iOS, and UWP)](https://developers.arcgis.com/net/latest/forms/guide/system-requirements.htm)
3. Fork and then clone the repo or download the .zip file.
4. Include (i) or reference (ii) the Toolkit in your projects:
* Note the Toolkit references [ArcGIS Runtime SDK for .NET](http://esriurl.com/dotnetsdk) by Nuget package. The package is automatically downloaded when you build the solution for the first time.
    1. Include the appropriate platform Projects in your Solution.
        - WPF (src\Esri.ArcGISRuntime.Toolkit\WPF\Esri.ArcGISRuntime.Toolkit.WPF.csproj)
        - UWP (\src\Esri.ArcGISRuntime.Toolkit\UWP\Esri.ArcGISRuntime.Toolkit.UWP.csproj)
        - Xamarin.Android (\src\Esri.ArcGISRuntime.Toolkit\Android\Esri.ArcGISRuntime.Toolkit.Android.csproj)
        - Xamarin.iOS (\src\Esri.ArcGISRuntime.Toolkit\iOS\Esri.ArcGISRuntime.Toolkit.iOS.csproj)
        - Xamarin.Forms (\src\Esri.ArcGISRuntime.Toolkit\XamarinForms\Esri.ArcGISRuntime.Toolkit.Xamarin.Forms.csproj)
    2. Build the Toolkit and reference the NuGet package you built.
        - Building each Toolkit project automatically creates the NuGet package for each platform in the project Output folder.
        - Create a local nuget source/feed and set it to the \Output\NuGet\Release folder.
        - Add the nuget package using the standard Nuget package manager dialog in Visual Studio.
        - It is also possible to create a nuget source pointing to the latest build (automatically updated after each pull-request gets merged): `https://ci.appveyor.com/nuget/arcgis-toolkit-dotnet`.
        - See [Setting Up Local NuGet Feeds](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/hosting-packages/local-feeds) for more information.
