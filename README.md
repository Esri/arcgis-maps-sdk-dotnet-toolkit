The ArcGIS Runtime SDK for .NET Toolkit contains controls and utilities you can use with [ArcGIS Runtime SDK for .NET](http://links.esri.com/dotnetsdk).

There are two ways to add Toolkit to your project:

1. **Install from Nuget** - the fastest way to get toolkit into your app
    - [Esri.ArcGISRuntime.Toolkit](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Esri.ArcGISRuntime.Toolkit)
	- [Esri.ArcGISRuntime.Toolkit.Xamarin.Forms](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Esri.ArcGISRuntime.Toolkit.Xamarin.Forms)
	- [Esri.ArcGISRuntime.ARToolkit](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Esri.ArcGISRuntime.ARToolkit)
	- [Esri.ArcGISRuntime.ARToolkit.Forms](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Esri.ArcGISRuntime.ARToolkit.Forms)
2. **[Build from source](https://esri.github.io/arcgis-toolkit-dotnet/buildingtoolkit.html)** - do this if you want to customize toolkit
