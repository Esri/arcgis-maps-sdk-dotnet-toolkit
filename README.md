arcgis-toolkit-dotnet
=====================

This project contains the set of controls for use with the Esri ArcGIS Runtime SDK for .NET.
Included are a number of controls you can use to enhance your applications. 


##What is in it?

ArcGIS Toolkit for .NET includes:

* `Legend` -  Displays a legend for a set of layers in your map.
* `Attribution` : Displays copyright/attribution information for layers in your map.
* `ScaleLine` : Displays current scale reference.
* `FeatureDataField` : Edit control for working with individual feature attributes.

## How Do I Use It?
* Get the Github Repo by either cloning it or downloading the zip package from the master branch.
* Add the Esri.ArcGISRuntime.Toolkit project to your existing solution.
* Right-click the project where you want to use the toolkit, select 'Add reference', and pick the toolkit project under the solutions tab.
* Next register the xmlns namespace in the `Page` or `UserControl` where you want to use the control:

```xml
  xmlns:esriTK="using:Esri.ArcGISRuntime.Toolkit.Controls" 
```

<i>Note: Some of the following examples assumes an ArcGIS map control named 'MyMap' is present.</i>

####Legend
Set the `Layers` property to the collection of layers you want to show legend for.
If you only want to display layers that are visible at the current scale range, also set the `Scale` property. Set this to 'NaN' (or don't set it) to avoid filtering by layer scale visibility.
Both of these properties are available for binding directly from the map. Example:
```xml
  <esriTK:Legend Layers="{Binding Layers, ElementName=MyMap}" 
    Scale="{Binding Scale, ElementName=MyMap}" />
```
Other useful properties:
* `ShowOnlyVisibleLayers` - Don't show legend for layers not currently visible
* `ReverseLayersOrder` - Reverses the layer order to easily order layers so that layers that are on top in the map is showing first in the legend. If you want more control over the order, use a converter or bind the collection via your view model to create a more custom collection.

####Attribution
Simply set the `Layers` property to those layers that you want to display attribution for. Note that the terms of use for many services requires you to display some form of attribution, and this control will make that easy for you.
```xml
  <esriTK:Attribution Layers="{Binding Layers, ElementName=MyMap}" />
```

####ScaleLine
```xml
   <esriTK:ScaleLine Scale="{Binding Scale, ElementName=MyMap}" />
```

####FeatureDataField
Set the `GdbFeature` property to the GdbFeature you want to work with, then set the `FieldName` property with the name of the field you would like to edit or display.

```xml
  <esriTK:FeatureDataField GdbFeature="{Binding MyGdbFeature}" FieldName="MyField" IsReadOnly="True" />
```

FeatureDataField Properties:
* `GdbFeature` - GdbFeature that contains information used for valiation requirements and defines UI for `FieldName`
* `FieldName` - The name of the field found in GdbFeature.Attributes that UI will be created for.
* `IsReadOnly` - Allows user to make an editable field readonly. Doesn't allow readonly fields to become editable.
* `Value` - The current value of the FeatureDataField control.
* `ValidationException` - `Exception` property that hold any messaged generated when the `Value` doesn't pass validation requirement.
* `ReadOnlyTemplate` - This `DataTemplate` is used if the `IsReadOnly` is true or if the `FieldInfo` defines the field as readonly.
* `InputTemplate` - This `DataTemplate` is used for standard input for string, number, and datetime types. 
* `SelectorTemplate` - This `DataTempalte` is used when `FieldInfo` defines a `CodedValueDomain`.
