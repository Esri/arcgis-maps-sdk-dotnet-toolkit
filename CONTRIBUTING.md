# Contributing to the ArcGIS Runtime Toolkit for .NET

This guide describes how you can contribute improvements to the ArcGIS Runtime Toolkit for .NET source code.

1. Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free).
2. To add an enhancement or fix a problem, create an issue.    
    * Be descriptive.  Clearly describe the issue including steps to reproduce and, if possible, a sample.  If an enhancement, clearly describe the additional functionality and provide a good use case to support it.     
3. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) the [ArcGIS Runtime Toolkit for .NET repo](https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-toolkit-dotnet/) on GitHub.
4. Clone it to your local machine.
5. Checkout the [main branch](https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-toolkit-dotnet/tree/main).
6. Create a new feature branch on your local machine.  The name of the branch is not important.     
7. Write code to add an enhancement or fix a problem.  
    * Follow the coding conventions already used in the source code.
    * Document your code.
    * Make commits of logical units.  
    * Use clear and descriptive commit messages.
8. Test your code.

### Submitting changes
1. Push the changes in your feature branch to your repo.
2. Submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) against the "main" branch. 
3. In the pull request comments, add a reference to the issue the pull request resolves.  For example, if the pull request resolves issue 45, add a comment to the pull request that includes "#45" (no quotes).    

### Code reviews
Expect a good amount of feedback as part of any pull request.  Pull requests will be reviewed and tested, and may be rejected for various reasons.  If rejected because it would cause a breaking change or includes a feature that is out of scope, it will be closed permanently.  If rejected because the proposed changes failed code review or testing, please review feedback, fix and reopen as necessary.  

### License
By contributing your code, you agree to license your contribution under the terms of the [Ms-PL](license.txt) license.      

Your contributions should be an original work of authorship by you, including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that is intentionally submitted for inclusion in this repo.
