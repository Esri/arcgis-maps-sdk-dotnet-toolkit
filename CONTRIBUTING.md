Esri welcomes contributions to our open source projects on Github. Please see our [guidelines for contributing](https://github.com/esri/contributing).

We do not currently accept new PRs for full features, for example a new Toolkit component or a significant change to an existing Toolkit component, but we do encourage you to submit issues for:
* Bugs you find while using the Toolkit.
* Requests for new Toolkit components or enhancements to existing Toolkit Components.

# Contributing to the ArcGIS Runtime SDK for .NET Toolkit

This guide describes how you can contribute improvements to the ArcGIS Runtime SDK for .NET Toolkit source code.

1. Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free).
2. To add an enhancement or fix a problem, create an issue.    
    * Be descriptive: Clearly describe the issue including steps to reproduce and, if possible, a sample. 
    * If an enhancement, clearly describe the additional functionality and provide a good use case to support it.     
3. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) the [ArcGIS Runtime SDK for .NET Toolkit repo](https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-toolkit-dotnet/) on GitHub.
4. Clone it to your local machine.
5. Checkout the [main branch](https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-toolkit-dotnet/tree/main).
6. Create a new feature branch on your local machine. The name of the branch is not important.     
7. Write code to add an enhancement or fix a problem.  
    * Follow the coding conventions already used in the Toolkit source code.
    * Document your code.
    * Make commits of logical units.  
    * Use clear and descriptive commit messages.
8. Self-review your code.
9. Test your code.

### Submitting changes

1. Push the changes in your feature branch to your repo.
2. Submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) against the "main" branch. 
3. In the pull request comments, add a reference to the issue the pull request resolves. For example, if the pull request resolves issue 45, add a comment to the pull request that includes "#45" (no quotes).    

### Code reviews

Expect a good amount of feedback as part of any pull request.
* Pull requests will be reviewed and tested, and may be rejected for various reasons.
    * If a PR is rejected because it would cause a breaking change or includes a feature that is out of scope, it will be closed permanently.
    * If a PR is rejected because the proposed changes failed code review or testing, please review feedback, fix and reopen as necessary.
