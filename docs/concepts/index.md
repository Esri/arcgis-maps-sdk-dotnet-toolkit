# ArcGIS Runtime toolkit for .NET

The ArcGIS Runtime SDK for .NET toolkit contains controls and utilities you can use with [ArcGIS Runtime SDK for .NET](http://links.esri.com/dotnetsdk).

There are two ways to use toolkit and AR toolkit in your apps:

1. [Install from Nuget](xref:84935635-E77D-4243-90D0-8721DE8D39B8) - the fastest way to get toolkit into your app
2. [Build from source](xref:3CCE1627-57F9-4ECB-A650-6D4D2E343337) - do this if you want to customize toolkit
